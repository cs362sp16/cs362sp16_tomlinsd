I found a bug (actually two) in the cardEffect function. Two of the values that are passed to the function feastCard were incorrect.
Instead of passing the current player and choice1, somehow they both got incremented to pass nextplayer and  choice2.
My process of finding this bug was just trolling through gdb. I was watching the game be played through my testDominion function.
I was checking variables before and after playing cards, and I noticed that weird things were happening when the feast card got played
(although this was not the only card to be acting weirdly). I decided to look further into it so I inserted breakpoints before and after
the feastCard function. Viewing all of the variables before and after playing the card, I realized where the error was and switched the
two values back.
Agan's first rule, understand the system, was important here. If I didn't know how the game was suppose'd to be played then I would not
have known there was erroneous actions happening (and I would've had to scour the program looking for an error).
The 7th rule, check the plug was also important here. It took me longer than i'd care to admit to find out that the error was with the
function call. The error was very simple and if I had assumed it was something more complex it could have taken me a whole lot longer to
figure out.
The 4th rule, divide and conquer was also helpful here. I was able to find out that the problem was specifically the function call when
I had breakpoints set just before and just after the cardFeast function is called.
