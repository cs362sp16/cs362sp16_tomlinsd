I found a bug (actually two) in the cardEffect function. Two of the values that are passed to the function feast are incorrect.
Instead of passing the current player and choice1, somehow they both got incremented to pass nextplayer and  choice2.
My process of finding this bug was just trolling through gdb. I was watching the game be played through my testDominion function.
I was checking variables before and after playing cards, and I noticed that weird things were happening when the feast card got played
(although this was not the only card to be acting weirdly). I decided to look further into it so I inserted breakpoints before and after
the feastCard function. Viewing all of the variables before and after playing the card, I realized where the error was and switched the
two values back.
