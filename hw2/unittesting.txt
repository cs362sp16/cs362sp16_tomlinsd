The process of unit testing was not too hard. I mainly stuck with cards that would be easy to test, since there is no line coverage
requirement. I mainly stuck with cards that would allow me to test them just by viewing the player's card count. If it wasn't changed
like it was supposed to then I knew something was wrong with the card.

After all of the tests are ran I get a 25.94% line coverage. That's not a very high percent which means there's still plenty of bugs
to be found in this code. Some of the tests barely had any line coverage at all, like with the cardtest 3 which tests the embargo card.
